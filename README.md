# LeNet-5 - The first step to CNN(s)

Convolutional Neural Networks are multi-layer neural networks that are trained using back-propagation. They are faster than normal perceptrons in recognizing visual patterns from images with minimal preprocessing. 

LeNet-5 was designed for handwritten and machine-printed character recognition by [Yann LeCun](http://yann.lecun.com/), [Leon Bottou](https://leon.bottou.org/start), [Yosuha Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org/) and [Patrick Haffner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-haffner-bbb386/)

It was introduced in the research paper [Gradient-based Learning Applied to Document recognition](http://vision.stanford.edu/cs598_spring07/papers/Lecun98.pdf) in the year 1998.
